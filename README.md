###Outline
<em>This Day in Star Wars History</em> is a fan-created webapp which tells users a significant event which occurred in the <em>Star Wars</em> franchise on the day they select.

The app runs in Rails and uses Bootstrap to ensure its design is responsive on all devices.

###To Do
Check GitHub Issues to find out what functionality is in the process of being added or improved.

###Testing
Currently, the app is tested solely with acceptance tests run via Cucumber using the Capybara DSL. I plan to add Unit Tests at a later date using RSpec.

In order to run the Cucumber tests, simply type:
```
bundle exec cucumber
```
